# Solar powered digital thermometer
Solar powered digital thermometer with 7-segment LCD display, working without batteries, forever.

## Idea
- No batteries
- Small solar panel
- 7 segment LCD
- Sticks on the window

## Plan
- [ ] Create a simulator first
  - simulates real system w/o the need for hardware
  - graphics in Javascript
    - C/C++ can interface Javascript with WASM
- [ ] Develop lib for LCD driver
- [ ] Develop lib for Temperature sensor
  - simple PT sensor with voltage divider is good enough
- [ ] Buy hardware
- [ ] Make breadboard circuit
- [ ] Develop PCB and Assemble components
- [ ] Test
